1. Read a file

2. Save it to buf[26]  - Mangheli

2.1. For testing print tetrimonos.

3. Check for a valid tetrimino  - Mangheli

4. Check for next tetrimino

5. Find out how many tetrimino are there and create a solution[4-11]

6. Calculate all the different unique "placements" of each indivitual tetriminoes in each of the solution[4-11] and them as nodes in doubly linked list

7. xxx

8. xxx

9. xxx


X. Print the solution using nodes.
